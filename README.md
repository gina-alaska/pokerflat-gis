Poker Flat Research Rocket Range GIS, Data Management and Decision Support

Poker Flat Research Rocket Range has asked GINA to build an interactive GIS (optionally web-based)
for plotting “predicted impact point” (based on WGS84 Lat/Lon in decimal degrees) surrounded by a
3σ circle representing the area within which the rocket will impact at the 90% confidence interval,
then intersecting the 3σ circle with an underlying populated places layer, land ownership
(e.g. native allotments), culturally significant sites, winter use areas (wood cutting, traplines etc)
and winter trails.  Data resulting from this intersection analysis will be used to generate a report
detailing those features that are contained by the 3σ circle which will help make the decision
to launch or not to launch.

This repo will be used to stage GIS data, project files, source code for custom tools, and
documentation.  

Project mgmt (communication and disucssions with the client, todo lists, ...) is maintained in
[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/2118492/projects/13719085)
